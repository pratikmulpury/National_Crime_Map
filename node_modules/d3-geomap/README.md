**d3.geomap** is designed to be a
[reusable](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/) geographic map for D3. In its current stage it consists of a class to create plain maps `d3.geomap()`
and one for choropleth maps `d3.geomap.choropleth()`.

Refer to the [documentation on how to use d3.geomap](http://d3-geomap.github.io/) and to download a bundle that contains minified versions of d3.geomap and its dependencies as well as TopoJSON files for creating world and individual country maps.
